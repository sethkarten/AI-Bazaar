Generate supply_unit_costs for firms and preferences (CES params) for consumers.

Used by BazaarWorld to assign heterogeneous costs and preferences when creating
firms and consumers. Per firm, costs across goods range [1, max]; firm i has
cost 1 for good i. Preferences are in (0, 1) per good (normalized to sum to 1),
consumers evenly distributed.

    Create supply_unit_costs for n firms and preferences for m consumers across k goods.

    - Supply costs: for each firm, costs across its k goods range from 1 to max_supply_unit_cost.
      Firm i has cost 1 for good i (good at index i); other goods get costs evenly spaced
      in (1, max] so each firm's costs span [1, max].
    - Preferences: each consumer gets k weights in (0, 1), normalized to sum to 1.
      Consumers are distributed evenly (consumer 0 more weight on first good, etc.).
